## Getting Started (Conceptual) üèÅ

(Based on typical MERN stack project structure)

1.  **Clone the repository.**
2.  **Backend Setup:**
    * Navigate to the `backend` directory.
    * Install dependencies: `npm install`
    * Create a `.env` file based on environment variables used in `index.js`, `db.js`, `cloudinary.js`, `isAuthenticated.js`. (e.g., `PORT`, `MONGO_URI`, `SECRET_KEY`, `CLOUD_NAME`, `API_KEY`, `API_SECRET`).
    * Start the server: `npm run dev` (uses nodemon).
3.  **Frontend Setup:**
    * Navigate to the `frontend` directory.
    * Install dependencies: `npm install`
    * Ensure the API endpoints in `src/utils/constant.js` point to the correct backend URL.
    * Start the development server: `npm run dev`
4.  **Access the application** in your browser (likely `http://localhost:5173` based on backend CORS config).
